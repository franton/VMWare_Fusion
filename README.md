# VMWare Fusion

This is a script and an extension attribute for JAMF's Casper Suite for VMWare Fusion.

The script will pull the current client's JSS record, find a serial number from a VMWare Fusion field and serialise any installed
version of VMWare Fusion.

The EA will simply return the current client's registered serial number to the JSS. If VMWare is not present, it will simply report
that a version of Fusion has not been installed.
